# snakeGame_w_JS
Snake Game with js, this code will be used to start training an AI so it can play snake and, hopefully, win. Or at least get good at it.

you can play it from here: https://ricci58lucas.github.io/snakeGame_w_JS/

Known bugs:

-When you, let's say, are going right, then press UP, and immediately afterwards press LEFT, you die.
I think it has something to do with the variable currentDir and its update
