# snakeGame_w_JS
Snake Game w/ js, this one will be used to start training an AI so it can play snake and, hopefully, win.

Known bugs:
-When you, let's say, are going right, then press UP, and immediately afterwards press LEFT, you die.
I think it has something to do with the variable currentDir and its update
